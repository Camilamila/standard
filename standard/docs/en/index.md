Open Contracting Data Standard: Documentation
=============================================

```eval_rst
.. note:: 

  This version of the OCDS documentation has been built to provide access a custom translation of OCDS prepared by The Mexican Government at the Federal Public Administration.

  This tailors the terminology in the schema to match official Mexican Government terminology. 

  This can be seen on the [reference page](schema/reference/) and through the [release schema viewer](schema/release/) as well as in the [raw schema file](release-schema.json) (JSON).

Governments around the world spend an estimated US$9.5 trillion through contracts every year. Yet, contracting information is often unavailable for public scrutiny. 

The Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS) enables disclosure of data and documents at all stages of the contracting process by defining a common data model. It was created to support organizations to increase contracting transparency, and allow deeper analysis of contracting data by a wide range of users.

The OCDS approach:

* Publish early, and iterate: improving disclosure step-by-step
* Simple and extensible JSON structure
* Publish data for each step of the contracting process
* Create summary records for an overall contracting process
* Re-usable objects: organizations, tender information, line-items, amounts, milestones, documents etc.
* Recommended data and documents at basic, intermediate & advanced levels
* Common open data publication patterns 
* Guidance on improving data collection and data quality
* A growing community of users and range of open source tools

## About

The Open Contracting Data Standard is a core product of the [Open Contracting Partnership](http://www.open-contracting.org) (OCP). 

Version 1.0 of the standard was developed for the OCP by the [World Wide Web Foundation](http://www.webfoundation.org), through a project supported by the [Omidyar Network](http://www.omidyar.com) and the [World Bank](http://www.worldbank.org). Ongoing development is managed by [Open Data Services Co-operative](http://www.opendataservices.coop) under contract to [OCP](http://www.open-contracting.org).

## Support

A [free helpdesk service](support/index.md) is available to support implementation and use of OCDS.
