# User needs

Open data is a means, not an end in itself. The first stage of any work with OCDS is to consider who will use the data that is produced, and which fields and features of the data are important to them.

In designing OCDS, we explored a range of different user needs and use cases for data on contracting. 

We focused on five main groups of user need, described below in greater detail:

* Generating market opportunities for the private sector to fairly compete for public contracts 
* Achieving value for money for government
* Strengthening the transparency, accountability and integrity of public contracting
* Monitoring the effectiveness of service delivery
* Improving internal efficiency

In practice these use cases might intersect.  For instance, having more transparent processes (public integrity) can increase competition (market opportunities) and lower prices (value for money).  

You can read more about how people around the world are using OCDS, and other contracting data, on the [Open Contracting Partnership website](https://www.open-contracting.org).

As you start implementing OCDS, consider how you will engage with data users, and how you will ensure the data and documents you make available will meet their needs. 

## Market opportunity

Generating market opportunities in public procurement means giving suppliers fair and equal access to procurement opportunities in order to improve competition, allow for more vendor diversity and enable innovation. This use case relates to using open contracting data, from the different stages of the process (from planning, to tender, award, contract, and implementation) to understand and describe the procurement market, analyze competition, and evaluate supplier performance.

The private sector can use open contracting data to understand the potential pipeline of procurement opportunities and identify the most competitive markets.  A government agency can use open contracting data to understand trends in past purchases to better plan for future procedures, analyze particular sectors to evaluate competition and identify  potential market concentration.  Moreover, authorities can use contracting data to understand their supplier base in order to design and implement strategies to increase vendor diversity, such as [increasing the participation of women owned businesses](https://www.open-contracting.org/what-is-open-contracting/gender/), small and medium enterprises, minority owned firms or firms committed to sustainability.  

**Key data fields**: Information about the procurement method used, the awarded suppliers, the companies that submit the bids, the tender and award values, details on the items procured are key fields to calculate relevant indicators related to market opportunity.  


## Value for money in procurement

Value for money refers to the effective, efficient and economic use of resources in public procurement across the different stages of the process. This means value for money might not be achieved considering only the price, but also assessing other non-price attributes such as quality of the items purchased and the efficiency of the process.  
 
In public procurement, for instance, value for money can be achieved when a contract is implemented competently (in a quality manner and in accordance with specifications) in a timely manner (achieving specified milestones by the specified dates) for a competitive price (at or below estimate).

Open contracting data can help public officials to get good value for money on the goods and services in the procurement process, and can also help in identifying whether value for money has been achieved in concluded contracts. Users from the private sector can analyze trends in prices and supplier performance, including terms of quality and duration, in order to identify better opportunities.  Civil society (e.g. NGOs, journalists, community organizations, etc.) can analyze this data to monitor government spending.

**Key data fields**: Information about the value amounts for the different stages of the process, unit prices and item details, are key fields to calculate relevant indicators related to value for money.  

## Promoting public integrity

In public procurement this use case relates to identifying, preventing and combating corruption, fraud, and other types of illicit behavior.  Proactively calculating red flag indicators and applying risk detection methods, using open procurement data, allow to potentially detect corruption and fraud before it happens and deter illicit behavior. This changes the anti-corruption approach from punitive to preventive. Monitoring anomalous procurement behavior, even when that behavior isn’t actually the result of a corrupt or illicit process, can help governments identify and resolve overarching inefficiencies in the procurement ecosystem.  

There are two main approaches to fraud and corruption monitoring. A ‘micro’ approach closely scrutinizes individual procurements, for example flagging a competitive procedure that received a single bid.  A ‘systemic’ approach looks for suspicious patterns in the whole market and makes links between datasets to map out networks of funding, ownership and interests, for example trying to identify if there is collusion in a particular market.  

All stakeholders from civil society, the private sector, government, and donors have an interest in identifying and combating corruption in public contracting.

**Key data fields**: To calculate indicators related to public integrity fields related to key documents from the different stages, the details of the bids (including who are the bidders and the values they offer), the item details, the value amounts of different stages of the process, the procurement method used and key dates, are particularly relevant.

## Monitoring service delivery
 
This use case relates to monitoring how public contracting delivers value to citizens in terms of quality of goods, works, and services provided. This involves being able to analyze in detail the implementation stage of the contracts, to verify whether the goods, works and services procured are being delivered in a timely manner, with good quality and at the agreed price. Also assessing the transactions, contract amendments and subcontracting arrangements is particularly important.  

Open contracting data on the implementation stages can help civil society organizations and citizens monitor service delivery in their communities and give feedback to the government.   For the government, having timely information on the delivery of the projects and contracts can be useful to identify inefficiencies, ensure the contracts are running efficiently and detect potential issues. 

**Key data fields**: To monitor service delivery contracts and implementation information is needed.  Fields related to amendments, milestones and transactions are particularly relevant. 

## Improving internal efficiency
Internal efficiency refers to ensuring that the financial, time, and human resource investments in a procurement process ultimately result in high quality service delivery and value for money. It helps governments to drive best procurement practices and systems while reducing the resources needed, such as money or personnels’ time.

Inefficiencies might arise due to poor systems or institutional frameworks that generate time delays and high transactional costs, complex technical processes, silos of information, lack of contract and award management processes, among others.  

This use case is particularly relevant for the government and public procurement agencies interested in making their procurement processes more efficient and identifying areas for improvement. For instance, tracking delays and the duration of the different stages of the process, structuring procurement information to improve internal processes and coordination, streamlining internal processes without duplicating efforts along the five phases of the contracting process, developing market engagement strategies to have better tender specifications, promoting the use of e-procurement systems, etc.  

**Key data fields**: Publishing key dates of the different stages of the process, the status of the tender, award and contract, are particularly relevant to analyze internal efficiency.
